# Testing to Learn!

As it says, one of the ways i learns (*sic*) is by testing. 

Here i am confirming that i can "stash" files in a branch and delete them in the master branch using the GitHub online portal. I am doing this because a few days ago, in a small branching melee, things did not work the way i expected. Thus, time for a test!

Eventually i'll figure out the git [stash](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v1/Git-Tools-Stashing) command but for now, i just want to stash some files out of the way and this seems a way to do that.
